# Fraud Analysis on the Customers:
In this Repo , I have done a Project on machine learning classification problem statement Which requires a Huge dataset where I got it from 3rd part websites and don't worry I want to share the dataset with you and you can get it from here:

Using Pandas library I loaded the dataset and also check the complete information about the dataset using the same library. since the data is having lot of Null values I am going to take help of statistics concept to clean the data and if my approach was not a good way for doing this Project Please let know. But while focusing on Missing values I got it know Last 2 rows are completely NAN so I removed the last 2 Rows.

yah After removing last 2 rows the data becomes quite good where only 2 columns having null values and remaining things are solved:
I am following Machine Learning pipeline for developing this project :

       - PipeLine of Machine Learning Project:
       - Collect the data
       - check the data information
       - split the data
       - training operations should be done on test data [Just Keep in Mind]
       - Handle Missing values if There
       - EDA Part [Exploratory Data Analysis]
       - Checking Normal Distribution
       - Checking Outliers
       - Handling them
       - Handle Cateogorical data
       - Transformation Techniques
       - select best features for both numerical and categorical data
       - Model developement
       - check validation
       - Evaluate model
       - check AUC and ROC For selecting Best Model
       - Hyperparameter tuning on the top of the best model
       - Save the model
       - Read the Model and check once again
       - Using Flask Integrate with HTML and CSS
       - Generate outcome in localhost
       - Deploy in Server
       - API Generation
       - Share our Project API
